libgpg-error-dev: old-style-config-script [usr/bin/gpgrt-config]

# upstream only ships gpgrt-config for use with gpg-error.m4 see
# upstream commits 1e7d0d3ef627f3cdee70b8409f04d7e2ecf4fdd6 and
# b5043421d2b3ff5999e88808737ff400bf15b0ee which indicate that
# gpgrt-config is considered an "internal command", and the manpage
# should relate only to the legacy/deprecated gpg-error-config, which
# we are not shipping.
